        During the experiment you will see some stimuli which youâ€™ll be asked to respond to their colours, as accurately and quickly as you can.<br><br>
            
            <strong>
                The experiment should be performed on a computer only (not on a phone or a tablet), in a quiet room with no distractions (please put your phone on silent).<br>
            </strong>
            <br>
            
            In this experiment we will use your webcam to measure your eye movements. Hence, we ask you to turn on your webcam.
            <br/><br/>
    
            <b>We will not see you and will not record any video of you.</b> </br>
    
            The program will automatically detect your eye movements without saving any recording from your webcam.
    
            <br/><br/>
    
    
    
            </br>
            Unfortunately, the software for detecting eye movements only works without glasses, if you wear glasses and have the option to take them off, you are welcome to continue without glasses.

            </br>
            
            
            Unfortunately, If you cannot turn your webcam on for this study, you will not be able to complete it and recieve a payment for it. 
            
            
           <br><br>
    
        
            The experiment consists of a cognitive task and a short questionnaire and takes about 30 minutes. You will receive one (1) SONA credits for participating.
