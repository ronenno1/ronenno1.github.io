                    During the current study by researchers Yarden Gliksman and Avishai Henik of Ben Gurion University of the Negev, you will be presented with stimuli on the computer. Your job will be to respond quickly and without errors according to the instructions presented to you at the beginning of the experiment. Your computer will register your answers and response times. The data collected will be confidential and will be visible only to the researchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the research causes you to suffer or experience emotional distress, you may wish to discontinue the study at any stage. Credit or payment will be given only if you complete the experiment.
